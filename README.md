# \<ken-burns-image\>

A Polymer Web Component that pans and zooms an image in a manner often referred to as the _[Ken Burns Effect](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ken_Burns_effect)_

The component provides a fixed size viewport in which the contained image is animated with scale and translate transforms.
Most all aspects of the animation are controlled by custom CSS styling or web component properties.

_[API Docs](https://vogelrh.github.io/ken-burns-image/components/ken-burns-image/)_
_[Demo](https://vogelrh.github.io/ken-burns-image/components/ken-burns-image/demo)_

Install the component with bower:

```bower install ken-burns-effect --save ```

### Usage

<!--
```
<custom-element-demo>
  <template>
    <link rel="import" href="ken-burns-image.html">
    <next-code-block></next-code-block>
  </template>
</custom-element-demo>
```
-->
```html
<ken-burns-image
   source="https://vogelrh.github.io/ken-burns-image/components/ken-burns-image/demo/kb_example.jpg"
   viewport-width="450px"
   viewport-height="250px"
   scale-start="0.96"
   scale-end="1.8"
   translate-x-end="-290px"
   translate-y-end="-180"  
></ken-burns-image>
```
 This example will create a viewport 450px by 250px to display the image. It starts the animation with the image not visible and scaled by 0.96. The image fades in then over the length of the animation, will end
 with a scale factor of 1.8 and shift the image to the left and down by -290px and -180px respectively before fading out at the end of the cycle. _See the Syling section
 for a description of the default values for the other properties that were not explicitly specified in the example._
